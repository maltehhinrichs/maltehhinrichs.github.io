I am a PhD student in Economics at [Queen's University Belfast](https://www.qub.ac.uk/), where I am a member of the [Centre for Economics, Policy and History](https://ceph.ie/), an all-Ireland centre of excellence funded by the Higher Education Authority North-South Research Programme, linking [Trinity College Dublin](https://www.tcd.ie/economics/) and [Queen's University Belfast](https://www.qub.ac.uk/schools/queens-business-school/).

My research focuses on water power and technological change during the Industrial Revolution. This research aims at contributing to a better understanding of the dynamics of the Industrial Revolution and the reasons behind and paths to long-run economic growth. For my doctoral research I am supervised by [Dr. Alan Fernihough](https://pure.qub.ac.uk/en/persons/alan-fernihough) and [Dr. Chris Colvin](https://www.chriscolvin.nl/).

Before moving to Belfast, I completed my Bachelor's and Master's studies at the [University of Mannheim](https://www.uni-mannheim.de/) in Germany. While there, I wrote my Master's thesis on "Engines of Growth? The Role of the Steam Engine for Long-Run Economic Development in Germany" and gained international experience as a visiting student at [NHH Norwegian School of Economics](https://www.nhh.no/en/) and [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://www.hkust.edu.hk/).
