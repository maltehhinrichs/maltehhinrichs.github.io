Welcome to my personal website!

I am a PhD student in Economics at Queen's University Belfast, where I am a member of the Centre for Economics, Policy and History, an all-Ireland centre of excellence funded by the Higher Education Authority North-South Research Programme, linking Trinity College Dublin and Queen's University Belfast.

My research focuses on renewable energy and technological change during the Industrial Revolution. This research aims at contributing to a better understanding of how water mills and steam engines shaped long-run economic development patterns across different regions. For my doctoral research I am supervised by Prof. Alan Fernihough and Dr. Chris Colvin.

Before moving to Belfast, I completed my Bachelor's and Master's studies at the University of Mannheim in Germany. While there, I wrote my Master's thesis on "Engines of Growth? The Role of the Steam Engine for Long-Run Economic Development in Germany" and gained international experience as a visiting student at NHH Norwegian School of Economics and Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.
